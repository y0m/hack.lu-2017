Dr. Honeypots - How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Know My Enemies (and Worms)

by Guillaume ARCAS

Nowadays there’s a “arm-race” when a new vulnerability is found or exploited between metasploit plugins developpers and honeypots coders. WannaCry & NotPetya incidents also showed that honeypots are not dead (they only go to github to recode).

This introductory worshop aims to give the attendees the basics on honeypotting deployment and pros & cons on this tools.

An install party is not excluded at the end of the workshop.

Note that as the author is member of The Honeynet Project, his visions about how useful honeypots are can be biased.
